# TweetSentiment

This repository contains code for training a model to extract tweet phrases to generate sentiment labels (negative, neutral, positive) based on kaggle tournament [Tweent Sentiment Extraction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tweet-sentiment-extraction). The model utilizes both token level details from Roberta and character level details using a Feedforward Multilayer Perceptron to generate sentiment for a tweet.
